📌 Project Title: C++ Student Grading System


🧾 Description:
This is my first C++ project — a student marks and grading system built using basic C++ concepts like arrays, loops, conditions, and user input.
It allows users to input multiple students' names, subject marks, calculates their total marks, average, and assigns a grade (A+ to F) based on the average.



🎯 Features:
Dynamic input of any number of students and subjects
Automatic total marks and average calculation
Assigns grades based on average
Clean and understandable C++ logic for beginners



📚 Concepts Used:
2D Arrays
Loops (for loops)
Conditionals (if-else)
Typecasting
String and integer handling
Basic I/O with cin and cout



💡 Why I Built This:
I wanted to test my logic-building skills by creating something useful and practical — this is the first step of my long coding journey in C++.
I believe in solving real problems through code, and this small project is a reflection of that belief.

🛠️ Future Updates (Coming Soon):
Input/output file support
Better user interface using functions
Add subject names
Rank students by marks
